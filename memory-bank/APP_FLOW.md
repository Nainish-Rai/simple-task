# App Flow Documentation

This document outlines the overall application flow for the project. It serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders to understand the various user journeys and key interactions within the application.

---

## 1. Overview

This application integrates multiple features, including calendar synchronization, event management, and smart scheduling. The flow is designed to provide a seamless experience from user authentication to event creation, editing, and notifications. The following sections describe the major flows and interactions.

---

## 2. User Flow

### 2.1. Onboarding & Authentication

- **Landing Page**:
  - Entry point displaying product features and sign-in options.
- **Authentication**:
  - Users can log in with OAuth providers (Google and Microsoft).
  - Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to their personalized dashboard.

### 2.2. Dashboard & Navigation

- **Dashboard/Home**:
  - Overview of upcoming events, calendar summary, and notifications.
  - Navigation menu includes links to Calendar, Event Manager, and Profile settings.
- **Navigation**:
  - Consistent header or sidebar for quick access.
  - Route transitions managed by Next.js for smooth user experience.

### 2.3. Calendar Flow

- **Calendar Views**:
  - Users can switch between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views using FullCalendar.js.
  - Calendar displays events fetched from external calendar APIs (Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook).
- **Event Interaction**:
  - Click on an event to view details.
  - Drag-and-drop functionality to reschedule events.
- **Event Creation & Editing**:
  - 'Create Event' button initiates a modal or dedicated page for event setup.
  - Forms validated using TypeScript to ensure data integrity.
  - Post event creation or modification, changes are synchronized with external calendars.

### 2.4. AI-Powered Smart Scheduling

- **Smart Scheduling Wizard**:
  - Users can invoke AI-powered features to suggest optimal time slots.
  - The flow begins with fetching availability, AI analysis, and returns recommended time slots.
- **User Confirmation**:
  - After reviewing suggestions, users can confirm booking, triggering event creation.

### 2.5. Notifications and Reminders

- **Notification Setup**:
  - Users can set reminders for events with customizable preferences.
  - Notification triggers via push notifications and emails.
- **In-App Alerts**:
  - A dedicated notifications section on the dashboard provides real-time alerts.

## 3. Technical Flow

### 3.1. Frontend Navigation

- **Routing**:
  - Utilizes Next.js dynamic routing for efficient page transitions.
  - Routes include `/dashboard`, `/calendar`, `/event/:id`, and `/profile`.
- **State Management**:
  - Global state management with React Context or state management libraries.
  - Local state managed in individual components using React hooks.

### 3.2. Data Flow & Database Interactions

- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - Connection managed through MongoDB utility in `lib/mongodb.ts`.
  - Prisma ORM handles database operations with type safety.
- **Data Models**:
  - User data and preferences stored in MongoDB collections.
  - Relationships managed through Prisma schema definitions.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - API routes interface with MongoDB through Prisma client.
  - Real-time data updates synchronized with frontend state.
- **Data Validation**:
  - Schema validation enforced at database level.
  - Additional TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety.

### 3.3. API Integration Flow

- **OAuth Integration**:
  - OAuth setup with NextAuth.js handles user sessions and token management.
- **Calendar API Communication**:
  - API routes fetch data from Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph API.
  - Event creation, updates, and deletions are synchronized via backend API routes.
- **AI Scheduling Service**:
  - Integration with an AI service (OpenAI API or a local model) to process scheduling suggestions.

### 3.4. UI and Animation Flow

- **UI Guidelines**:
  - Components styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui as per the frontend guidelines.
- **Animation & Transitions**:
  - Framer Motion used for smooth animations during page transitions and modal interactions.
- **Iconography**:
  - Consistent use of Lucide Icons for interactive elements and notifications.

## 4. Workflow Diagrams (Optional)

- **User Journey Diagram**: Visual diagram mapping user flow from landing page to calendar interaction.
- **Component Interaction Diagram**: Diagram showing how authentication, calendar APIs, and UI components interact.
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Illustrates the flow of data between frontend, API routes, and MongoDB.

_Note: Diagrams can be created using tools like Figma or Lucidchart and linked here._

## 5. Next Steps & Considerations

- **Testing**: Validate flows with unit and integration tests.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate feedback loops for iterative improvements.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor flow and performance metrics during beta testing to ensure seamless UX.
- **Documentation**: Update this document as new features are integrated or flows change.
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Monitor MongoDB query performance
  - Implement database indexing strategies
  - Set up data backup and recovery procedures
