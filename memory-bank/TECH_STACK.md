# Tech Stack Documentation

This document outlines the technologies, frameworks, and tools used in the project. It serves as a reference for developers and stakeholders to understand the underlying architecture and development environment.

---

## 1. Core Technologies

- **Next.js & React**:  
  The application is built using Next.js, which leverages React for component-based development and provides features like server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**:  
  TypeScript is used to enhance code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity through its static type-checking capabilities.
- **Vite**:  
  Vite is utilized as the build tool, offering fast development server start-up times and optimized builds.

---

## 2. UI Framework & Styling

- **shadcn/ui**:  
  A collection of well-designed, reusable UI components that serve as the foundation for the project's design system.
- **Tailwind CSS**:  
  Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling. The configuration is customized in `tailwind.config.js` to define themes, breakpoints, and design tokens.
- **Framer Motion**:  
  Framer Motion is employed for creating smooth, engaging animations and transitions across the user interface.
- **Lucide Icons**:  
  Lucide Icons are integrated for scalable and customizable iconography throughout the application.

## 3. Database & Data Management

- **MongoDB**:  
  MongoDB serves as the primary database, providing a flexible, document-based storage solution that scales well with the application's needs.
- **Prisma ORM**:  
  Prisma is used as the database toolkit and ORM, offering:
  - Type-safe database queries
  - Automatic migrations
  - Database schema management
  - Rich query capabilities
- **MongoDB Atlas**:  
  Cloud-hosted MongoDB service for reliable database operations and easy scaling.

## 4. State Management & Data Flow

- **React Context & Hooks**:  
  Global and local state management is handled with React Context and custom hooks. This enables clean component hierarchies and effective state sharing.
- **API Integration**:  
  Data fetching strategies include Next.js API routes and external API services (e.g., Google Calendar API, Microsoft Graph API) for tasks such as calendar synchronization and event management.

---

## 5. Development Tools

- **Code Quality**:
  - **ESLint**: Enforces coding standards and helps catch issues early.
  - **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase.
- **Testing Frameworks**:  
  Unit and integration tests are implemented using Jest and React Testing Library to maintain robust and reliable components.
- **Development Environment**:  
  The project leverages modern development practices with a focus on fast iteration cycles and continuous integration.
- **Version Control**:
  - **Git**: Version control is managed through Git. Branching strategies and pull requests ensure code reviews and maintain code integrity.

---

## 6. Performance & Optimization

- **Build Optimization**:
  - Vite ensures rapid builds and hot module replacement.
  - Next.js is configured for efficient static generation and server-side rendering.
- **Code Splitting**:
  Dynamic imports and lazy loading are used to optimize performance and reduce initial load times.
- **Performance Monitoring**:
  Tools and practices for monitoring performance are integrated to track load times and runtime efficiency.

---

## 7. Dependencies & Versions

- **Core Dependencies**:

  - Next.js, React, and TypeScript form the foundation of the application.
  - shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Lucide Icons provide the UI and animation frameworks.
  - MongoDB and Prisma handle data persistence and database operations.

- **Dev Dependencies**:

  - ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and other tooling are included to maintain high code quality and ensure a smooth development process.

- **Version Management**:
  - Dependency versions are managed via `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to ensure consistency across environments.
  - Regular updates and maintenance are performed to keep the tech stack current and secure.
