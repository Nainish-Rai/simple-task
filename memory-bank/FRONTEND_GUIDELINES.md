# Frontend Guidelines

This document outlines the frontend development guidelines for Cline's context. It details the technologies, best practices, and patterns to be followed using the following stack:

- **Next.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **shadcn/ui**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Framer Motion**
- **Lucide Icons**

---

## 1. Project Structure & Architecture

### Next.js & App Directory Structure

- Use the latest Next.js version with the new `app/` directory if available.
- Organize pages, layouts, and components logically:
  - `/app` – Routes and layouts
  - `/components` – Reusable UI components
  - `/hooks` – Custom React hooks
  - `/utils` – Utility functions and helpers
- Maintain clear separation between business logic and presentation components.

### TypeScript Configuration

- Follow the strict mode settings in `tsconfig.json` for a resilient codebase.
- Organize type definitions in a dedicated `/types` folder.
- Use type aliases and interfaces to clearly define data structures and props.

---

## 2. Component Development Guidelines

### shadcn/ui Integration

- Utilize shadcn/ui components as a base for common UI patterns.
- Extend and customize components to meet design requirements.
- Create a consistent design system by adhering to shadcn’s component guidelines.

### Reusable Components

- Write small, composable, and reusable components.
- Keep components stateless when possible; lift the state up when managing shared state.
- Use clear and descriptive prop names and enforce prop types through TypeScript.

### Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

- Implement dynamic import for heavy components to improve performance.
- Leverage Next.js’ built-in dynamic routing and lazy loading capabilities.
- Use React’s `Suspense` and error boundaries for better UX during lazy load.

---

## 3. Styling Guidelines

### Tailwind CSS Organization

- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Configure your `tailwind.config.js` to define custom colors, spacing, and breakpoints.
- Organize styles by component; consider using component-specific style files when necessary.

### Design Tokens & Custom Utilities

- Define a consistent color palette and spacing scale within Tailwind configuration.
- Create reusable utility classes for common styling patterns.
- Implement dark mode and responsive design using Tailwind’s features.

## 4. Animation Standards

### Framer Motion Best Practices

- Use Framer Motion for declarative animations and interactive UI feedback.
- Create animation variants for reusability across components.
- Maintain consistency in motion values (duration, easing) to ensure a coherent experience.
- Favor simple animations that enhance user experience without distracting from content.

### Performance Optimization

- Avoid over-animating UI elements; focus on intended user interaction.
- Monitor animation performance and ensure frame rates are maintained.

---

## 5. Icon System

### Lucide Icons Integration

- Use Lucide Icons for scalable, customizable icons.
- Create a wrapper component for icons to standardize properties (size, color, aria labels).
- Maintain a consistent icon style throughout the application.
- Extend or customize icons when necessary to align with the overall design aesthetic.

---

## 6. Development Workflow

### Code Quality & Best Practices

- Enforce linting and formatting using ESLint and Prettier.
- Write unit and integration tests using preferred libraries (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).
- Use Git for version control and ensure code reviews for all pull requests.

### Documentation & Maintenance

- Document components and hooks using JSDoc or TypeScript comments.
- Maintain updated READMEs and developer notes to onboard new team members.
- Monitor performance and refactor components as the project evolves.

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

- Set up CI pipelines to run tests and linting on each commit.
- Use a staging environment to test new releases before production deployment.
- Monitor release versions and maintain rollback strategies as needed.

---

## 7. Additional Recommendations

- **Modularization:** Keep the code modular to facilitate easy updates and refactoring.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure all components are responsive and accessible on various devices.
- **Accessibility:** Follow ARIA guidelines and accessibility best practices for interactive elements.
- **Collaboration:** Encourage peer reviews and regular communication within the team for consistency.

This document serves as a living guide for frontend development best practices. It is expected that the team reviews and updates these guidelines periodically to adapt to evolving project needs and industry standards.
