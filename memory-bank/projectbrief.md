# Project Brief

## Overview

This document serves as the foundation for the project, outlining its core purpose, objectives, and key architectural decisions.

## Core Purpose

A Next.js-based calendar application that provides seamless scheduling experiences through AI-powered smart scheduling and integration with popular calendar services.

## Key Objectives

1. Provide intuitive calendar management with Google and Outlook integration
2. Implement AI-powered smart scheduling for optimal time slot suggestions
3. Deliver robust event management capabilities
4. Ensure secure authentication and data handling
5. Maintain high performance and responsive design

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend

- Next.js with App Router for modern React development
- TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience
- shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for consistent, beautiful UI
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Lucide Icons for consistent iconography

### Backend

- Next.js API Routes for serverless backend functionality
- MongoDB for flexible, document-based data persistence
- Mongoose ODM for MongoDB schema management and interactions
- NextAuth.js for secure authentication with MongoDB adapter
