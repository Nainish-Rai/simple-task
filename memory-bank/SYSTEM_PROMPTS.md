# System Prompts Documentation

This document outlines the system prompts configuration and guidelines for our application. It serves as a reference for developers and AI operators to understand the context, purpose, and usage of system prompts within the system.

## 1. Overview & Purpose

- **Purpose**: To define structured system prompts that guide the behavior and responses of the system.
- **Usage**: These prompts are used to set context, manage task execution, handle errors, and motivate desired outcomes.
- **Audience**: Developers, AI trainers, and operations teams.

## 2. Prompt Categories

### 2.1. General Prompts

- **Context Initialization**: Prompts to set up the systemâ€™s background context and knowledge base.
- **Role Definition**: Guidelines to clearly define the AI's persona and role during interactions.

### 2.2. Task-Specific Prompts

- **Instruction Prompts**: Directives to outline tasks, expected formats, and processing steps.
- **Detail Enhancement**: Prompts that encourage the AI to ask clarifying questions when the provided input is ambiguous.

### 2.3. Error Handling Prompts

- **Error Recovery**: Instructions to manage errors and provide graceful recovery advice.
- **Clarification Requests**: Prompts used when the input is insufficient or unclear.

## 3. Usage Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform language and structure across all prompts.
- **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Modularity**: Structure prompts as independent modules that can be reused across different contexts.
- **Safety & Moderation**: Include instructions for content moderation and user safety when necessary.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure prompts are concise and optimized for prompt processing.

## 4. Examples and Templates

### 4.1. General Context Prompt Template

```
Your task is to [specific task]. Make sure to [instruction]. Once completed, provide [output format or summary].
```

## 5. Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Regularly update prompts based on feedback and evolving requirements.
- **Testing**: Continuously test prompts to ensure they yield the intended outcomes.
- **Versioning**: Maintain a clear version history for audit and rollback purposes.

## 6. Version History

- **v1.0** (2025-02-10): Initial creation of the system prompts documentation.

## 7. Special Instructions & Considerations

- Adapt prompts to different scenarios and audiences as necessary.
- Cross-reference related documentation such as "APP_FLOW.md", "PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md", and "FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md" for a comprehensive view of the system.
- Always test new prompts in a controlled environment before rolling them out to production.
